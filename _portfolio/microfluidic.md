# Printing Parameters
Both the PLA and TPU filament are printed on a bed heated to 60 C. The majority of the print settings remain the same. Here are the differences in printing parameters between PLA and TPU:
* **Extruder Temperature:** PLA is extruded at 210 C, and TPU is extruded at 240 C.
* **Print Speed:** Because it is flexible, TPU must be printed slower. The maximum print speed for PLA is 60 mm/s, and the maximum print speed for TPU is 25 mm/s.
* **Retraction Speed:** TPU must be retracted slower than PLA. The TPU retraction speed is set to 15 mm/s.
