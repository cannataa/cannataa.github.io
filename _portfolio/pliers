# About
Print-in-place parts are an exciting application of 3D printing. Instead of printing multiple parts that must be assembled in order to be functional, print-in-place parts are fully functional as soon as they are removed from the bed; no post-processing or assembly is required. More complex print-in-place parts are possible with dual extrusion printing. Portions of the printed part can have different properties, depending on the filament used. For example, flexible filament such as TPU can be used for the joints of a part, while a rigid filament such as PLA or ABS can be used to form the rigid components.
